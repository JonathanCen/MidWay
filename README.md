# MidWay ðŸ§­

MidWay is a web application that computes a rough midpoint of two addresses and gathers locations of popular businesses around the midpoint for friends to meet and try together. With the purpose of reducing the time spent on traveling and more time hanging out and exploring with friends. Test it out: [Live Demo](<ADDRESS>).

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

To run this application locally on your computer, you'll need `Git` and `Node.js` (which comes with `npm`) installed on your computer. Additionally, you would need to sign up to and generate API keys from [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#creating-api-keys), [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/authentication), and [GeoDB Cities](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities).

    cd ../midwayfrontend

Install all dependicies

    npm install

Go into the root directory

    cd ..

Run the app

    npm run dev

## TODO
- [ ] Allow functionality to compute the midpoint using the distance of the starting locations.
- [ ] Allow users to enter more than 2 starting locations.
